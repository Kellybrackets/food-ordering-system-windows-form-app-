In my Windows Form Pizza Ordering System app, the user experience is enhanced through intuitive features like checkboxes and radio buttons. As a user, I can easily customize my pizza by selecting or deselecting toppings using checkboxes. This not only streamlines the ordering process but also ensures that my preferences are accurately captured.

The radio buttons, on the other hand, come in handy when making exclusive choices, such as selecting a pizza size. They allow me to pick a single option from a set, ensuring clarity and preventing conflicting selections.

The combination of checkboxes and radio buttons provides a visual and user-friendly interface, making the pizza customization process seamless. It's a practical way to ensure that my order is precisely tailored to my preferences, creating a satisfying and interactive ordering experience.In my Windows Form Pizza Ordering System app, the user experience is enhanced through intuitive features like checkboxes and radio buttons.
